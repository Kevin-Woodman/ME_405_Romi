# ME_405_Romi
The Romi Project tasked teams of two students with developing a Micropython-based, autonomous, two-wheel-drive
robot which competed in time-trials of a fixed track. The project exercised a holistic view of the mechatronics
discipline, incorporating elements of mechanical design, electrical engineering, computer science, and control theory.
